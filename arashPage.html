						<p>A mobile social robot named “Arash” has been designed for educational and therapeutic interventions for children with cancer in a hospital environment. Many children are hospitalized for different diseases, among these children with cancer experience special condi-tions and needs due to complex and painful surgeries. In particular, they suffer from physical pain caused by both cancer and its treatments process. Moreover, cancer treatment causes emotional distress which can reduce the efficiency of the treatments. Using social robots to interact with children in a hospital environment could decrease these children’s distress, thereby improving the efficiency of their treatment.<br>
							“Arash” is a mobile social robot designed and developed for pediatric cancer interventions for children aged from 4 to 12 years old in order to accommodate their needs and conditions (pre-and-post surgery) in a hospital environment. The design of the robot’s appearance and look were based on evaluation of several design alternatives identified in surveys taken by children with chronic diseases at three hospitals in Tehran.
